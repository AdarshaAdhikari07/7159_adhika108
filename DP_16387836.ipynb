        "The Subset Sum Problem (SSP) is a classical computational decision problem, and the problem is whether a subset of a set of positive integers sums to a particular target value (Costandin, 2024). In mathematical notation, with set S = {x1, x2,..., xn} and target value t, one wants to know whether there is a subset of S the elements of which sum up to t. This formulation of the problem has only a true or false value, as a result of which it became a decision problem, but not a search or optimisation one.\n",
        "The SSP is also central to the theory of computation since it is one of the basic forms of an NP-complete problem. It is an introduction to more intricate issues in combinatorics and algorithm design (Luo et al. 2024). As an example, given a set of inputs S = {1, 2, 3, 10} and target value t = 13, the function shall evaluate as true because the sums of {1, 2, 10} and {3, 10} are correct. Because of its format, the problem is especially helpful when picturing and comparing brute-force search algorithms and more superior dynamic programming routines."

        "The exhaustive search algorithm of the Subset Sum Problem is a recursive algorithm which is based on searching all the possibilities of inclusion and exclusion of components of a set (GeeksforGeeks, 2012). To begin with, the first element, the algorithm examines two options: either to add it to the sum or to bypass it at each step. In the base case, the target is zero, and hence it returns true since a valid subset has been identified. When the target is negative or the limit has been reached unsuccessfully, it yields false. The procedure is applied recursively until a solution is reached in both the include and exclude branches or until all combinations are searched in recursion. This is simple in terms of logic, but this approach is exponential because it considers every possible subset of 2^n items. Although the recursive approach is not practical in the case of large datasets, it illustrates the structure of decisions to be made on the problem and provides an intuitive demonstration of the problem before the application of optimised alternatives such as dynamic programming (Wang et al. 2024).\n"

        "Dynamic programming provides a more optimal approach compared to SSP, in that it divides a problem into overlapping subproblems and memorises the intermediate results of computations (simplilearn, 2025). It follows the insight that, whenever a sum s can be achieved using the first k elements, then s + x_(k+1) can as well be achieved after incorporating the next element. The algorithm does not even calculate more than once by solving the problem in a step-by-step approach progressively, with smaller targets leading to larger targets.\n",

Both methods make a great difference in difficulty in time by making it O(n * t), where n is the size of the set, and t is the degree of the target. This qualifies them to manipulate moderately huge amounts of data that would otherwise be impossible with brute force applications.\n",

First, the table is initialised with false values, except the first column, which is set to be true because a sum of zero can always be obtained by choosing no items.\n",

When the element in consideration is too big, then the algorithm transfers the value of the preceding row.\n",

On each element of S and each possible sum between 1 and t, the algorithm tests whether that sum can be obtained using or not the element under consideration.\n",
        "In case S[i-1] is not greater than j, then dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] or dp[i-1][j - S[i-1]]. Otherwise, dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j], i.e. the value of a current element is too high to be contained. After filling the table, one will find the answer at dp[n][t], which shows whether the target sum is possible to accomplish.\n",
        "This is a very systematic approach and not based on recursion, so it becomes easy to debug and hence easy to understand. On one test, with the input value S = [54, 35, 55, 74, 74, 34, 69, 35, 88, 100] and t = 69, the algorithm properly found that a valid subset existed, and the procedure returned true. The main strength of the bottom-up approach is the fact that it ensures the complexity of running it to be a polynomial, and it also gives a clear way to the solution.\n"

        "The Subset Sum Problem is an interesting exploration of the influence that the algorithmic methods have on the computational performance. The exhaustive search algorithm is very easy to use, but soon it becomes infeasible because the number of subsets increases exponentially. Dynamic programming, in contrast, offers a scalable and efficient solution to the problem either through memoisation or bottom-up table filling.\n",
        "An advantage of the memoization technique is that it cuts down on the number of times a given function is called by storing intermediate results. The impression lends itself especially when used together with recursion. The bottom-up approach, in its turn, suggests a completely iterative solution, which is easy to visualise and very effective to implement. Each of them is much faster than the brute-force solution, and both show the expediency of using dynamic programming.\n",
        "All in all, it is the dynamic programming strategy that can be deemed as the most efficient way of tackling the Subset Sum Problem reliably and computationally efficiently. It makes a theoretically intractable problem manageable and solvable (with no certainty but with reasonable input sizes).\n"
